               "This Bastion, one of the smallest sixteenth-century bulwarks, was dedicated to San Giorgio,
               protector of the castellan. Half-sinked by the 1669 eruptions, the Bastion was found
               during excavations carried out between the end Suca of the eighteenth-century and the beginning of the
               nineteenth-century, but it then got forgotten and overwhelmed by the new factories.
               Today, it still appears covered by lava and victim of any sort of vandalism,
               being it in a neighborhood at social risk."

               "Started in 1555 and never completed, this Bastion took its name from San Michele's Church,
               which was later transfered in Via Etnea during the eighteenth-century.
               After 1693's earthquake the Bastion was exploited to create residences and was modified at the point
               it was unrecognizable: in fact, only a very small portion of the renaissance shoe wall remains in Via Coppola,
               where it remains part of an eighteenth-century building, Suca accessible only from the courtyard
               on the street number 43. The rest of the building is a elegant noble palace of the early
               twentieth century, now devoid of any element that reminds its original military function."

               "'Il Bastione degli Infetti' is the best preserved among the bastions that constituted
               the Etneo difensive system. Cicero tell in the Verrine that in the place where today are the remains
               of the bastion stood the Temple of Ceres, place of worship and pilgrimages.
               The name derives from the transformation of the Bastion into a lazaretto in 1576, because of the plague
               that hit the city of Catania."

               "Left unharmed by the eruption of 1669 it was partly destroyed by the earthquake that occurred in the same year,
               but it was the negligence and the degradation of the following centuries that definitively altered its physiognomy."

               "The Bastion Santa Croce costituted the external defense of the castle Ursino and was located east
               along the Gammazita curtain and was partly destroyed because of the 1669 eruption;
               it was armed with 2 pieces of artillery."

            "'Il Bastione del Tindaro' was initially part of the city's defensive system in the 16th century.
            It then became border of the benedectine's garden, who bought it to delimit the green area of their monastery.
            Today, all the rests of the Bastion are a few structures inside the Vittorio Emanuele Hospital
            and along the Tindaro alley.
            The Bastion took its name from the demolished church dedicated to the Madonna del Tindaro, which was
            demolished to make space for the Vittorio Emanuele Hospital and the Spedalieri high school."

                "'Il Bastione del Santo Carcere' was built in the 16th century to protect the Vetere,
                the city's first cathedral, linked by tradition to the places of martyrdom of S. Agata.
                After the earthquake in 1693, it was partly demolished to obtain the facade of the S. Agata al Carcere's church.
                Today, it is an obligatory stop for the Feast of S. Agata."

               "'La Porta di Carlo V' is the only gate among the sixteenth century walls of Charles V
                and remains intact at the Fishmonger's. Previously known as "Porta dei Canali",
                took its name from the homonym fountain on which it overlooked and is the only surviving gate.
                On top of it a marble plaque engraved in characters and Latin language expresses the
                desire of Charles V to equip the city of Catania with walls."

               "'La Porta della Decima' was also known as 'Porta Siracusa' and was born in sostitution
                of the ancient Porta Ariana. Its existence is confirmed in Middle Ages, as it is written
                in history books. The Gate took its name from the tithing ("Decima" in italian),
                a tax that forced the farmers to pay one-tenth of the harvest as a tribute to the king."

               "Also known as 'Porta de Verga' and rebuilt in 1553, it replaced
               a more ancient gate - La Porta del Porto - and took its name from the viceroy Juan de Vega to whom it was dedicated.
               In the eighteenth century it became a cause of discord between the archdiocese and the family Paternò Castello, both parts
               bordering the Porta and interested in his control. It was demolished during nineteenth century for the widening of the alley
               that reached the port, today known as Via del Porticello."

               "Born to guarantee an access to the city from the little
               Porto Aragonese, its uncertain location had to be not too far from the current Piazza Duca di Genova.
               It was demolished toghether with the stretch of walls on which it faced for the making of the new sixteenth century
               curtain which surrounded the Civita district."

                "This gate owes its name to the metal grille that closed it: according to the
                tradition, it was obtained with the loot of Tunis following the victory reported in 1535 by Charles V and Andrea Doria's
                fleet against the pirate Barbarossa."

               "This gate was previously called Porta Aquilonare. Thanks to his location on the aragonese-period walls,
               it became the privileged entrance to the city of the sovereigns of the Trinacria Kingdom,
               directly devoted to the ancient church of S.Agata la Vetere, first seat of the bishopric chair and traditionally
               seat of the tomb of the patroness of the city. The gate used to open where today is Via Santa Maddalena,
               right in front of Stanta Maria della Purità e della Visitazione's church."

               where it's now located the Vittorio Emanuele II Hospital, it got destroyed by the 1669 cast,
               its name appears to be linked to the nearby Bastion."

               "Porta di Sant'Orsola, previously called 'Posterna Joenio', was opened in 1671. The gate was
               located near the church of S.Orsola, in the area of the current Piazza Scammacca, behind Teatro Massimo,
               and was demolished after the 1693 earthquake to trace the new roads of Catania."

               "Erected in the defensive system of the moat of Castello Ursino during the 16th century,
               it was also entirely demolished by the 1693 eruption. Its exact location is not
               yet clear, probably in the west zone of Piazza Federico II di Svevia."

               "Probably from Middle Age, it opened slight after Bastione di San Giovanni.
               Its destruction happened during the 1669 eruption, which cast came through this gate to stop several meters inside,
               close to Piazza Santi Cosma e Damiano, today called Piazza Niccolò Machiavelli."

               crossroad with Via Plebiscito, it was rebuilt with the 16th-century fortification plan.
               Never completed, it was demolished in 1792 to expand Via Garibaldi. It owes its name to the fief or Sardinia,
               rich land in the west of the city."

                "There were two gates with this title: the first, of undefined age, was perhaps from the Aragonese age,
                opening to the walls of that period; the second one replaced it in the sicteenth century, erected not far behind
                and collapsed during the 1693 earthquake. The few rests were demolished for the extension of the Lanza road,
                that is now called Via Antonino di San Giuliano."

               "The city walls had several 'service' openings, called 'Postierle', usually not reported in the general plans as secondary accesses.
               However, thanks to some prints signed by Tiburzio Spannocchi who was entrusted with the supervision of the wall
               in view of their reformulation and strenghtening, we are able to identify with certainty at least one of them:
               Porta della Cunzaria, located near Bastione Grande,led to a tannery of skins that in the 16th century was located where today the Harbor Customs rises and that in the eighteenth century was adapted to lazzaretto, on a lava spur
               overlooking the sea."

               "Also knows as 'Fontana de' setti caneddi', today it is located below a great arch,
               close to Palazzo dei Chierici, in a lower street level than Piazza Duomo as it was built before the earthquake.
               The original fountain of the 36 canals was placed along the walls opposite the gate and in the overlying part
               presented paintings depicting the story of the river god Amerano. It was destroyed by the eruption of 1669."

               "Fonte Lanaria owes its name to the governor Francesco Lanario Duca di Carpignano.
               The inscription to S.Agata is linked to the tradition that the fountain marks the point from which S.Agata's
               relics for Byzantium left by order of general Giorgio Meniace. In february, feast of the patron S.Agata, the
               simulacrum runs through the ancient part of the walls; the fountain, in occasion of this anniversary,
               is destination of pilgrims and devotees."

               "After the 1693 earthquake, Ignazio Paternò Castello III, Prince of Biscari, obtained from the General Liutenant
               Giuseppe Lanza, Duke of Camastra, the permission of building a new palace on the enbankment of the sixteenth century
               Charles V's walls. The construction works lasted more than a century and the biggest Catanian archtects
               of the time (Alonzo di Benedetto, Girolamo Palazzotto, Francesco Battaglia) took part in these works.
               The most sumptuous private palace of Catania was built: the beauty of carvings and sculpture wasn't only the result of taste
               and style; it reflected the technical and artistics ability of the catanian workers."

               "The palace was built with a trapezoidal plan, centralized on a large courtyard where a central pincer
            staircase introduced into the rich walls. It reached its maximum splendor in 1700 thanks to Ignazio V Prince of Biscari, great
            traveler and fond of litrature, art and architecture. The prince personally partecipated in the design of the new wings of the palace
            providing original and constructive solutions."

               "The Ursin Castle was part of a fortification
            long the coasts of southern italy and sicily wanted by Federico di Svevia, for a military construction plan. It was surroundedon three sides
            by the sea and defended by a mighty wall. After the introduction of the gunpowder in 16th century, the castle's military role was
            more and more weakened until it became a prison. It was invested and demaged by the 1669 eruption, when the lava arrived around the castle
            and although it didn't damage the castle's structures, it filled the moat, covered the ramparts and even moved the coast line for a few
            hundred meters. The 1693 earthquake damaged again the castle, definitively compromising its military role. Around 1930, the castle was radically
            restaured and became a museum."

               "'Cortina di Gammazita' is part of the 16th century wall and is located in the south-west area
            of the turistic center of Catania; It linked the Ursin Castle and Charles V's Gate. This stretch of walls skirted the ruins of
            ancient factories that took the name of 'Muro rotto'. In the Middle Age, this part of the city was seat of the Judecca Suttana, the
            ebraic district, and was rich of commercial activities. In 1621 Don Francesco Lanario, general superintendent for the fortifications,
            restaured both the defensive asset of the city and the area around the fount. The waters of Gammazita were thus harnessed and joined
            to those of the Amenian. In 1669, after the eruption, the lava surrounded the Ursin Castle, filling its moat and invading the district
            covering the founts, including that of Gammazita."
